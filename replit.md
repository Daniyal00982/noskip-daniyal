- **ESBuild**: Production bundling for server code
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migration management
- **TSX**: TypeScript execution for development

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. Frontend builds to `dist/public` using Vite
2. Backend bundles to `dist/index.js` using ESBuild
3. Shared schemas compiled and included in both builds

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API access token (required)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment flag for development/production

### Production Requirements
- Node.js runtime environment
- PostgreSQL database (Neon recommended)
- OpenAI API subscription
- Environment variables configured

### Development Setup
- `npm run dev`: Starts development server with hot reload
- `npm run db:push`: Applies database schema changes
- `npm run build`: Creates production build
- `npm start`: Runs production server

The application uses a memory storage fallback for development when database is unavailable, but requires PostgreSQL for production deployment.
